<h2>Hey Mote,
I just want to say I’m really sorry if anything I did made you feel insecure or unimportant. 
That was never my intention, and it hurts me to know you felt that way. 
You matter to me more than you know, and I appreciate you for who you are—completely.
I want to be someone who makes you feel safe, valued, and confident in this relationship.
Please know I’m here for you, and I’m willing to understand and work through anything that’s bothering you. 
We’re a team, and I care deeply about your feelings. ❤️!</h2>
